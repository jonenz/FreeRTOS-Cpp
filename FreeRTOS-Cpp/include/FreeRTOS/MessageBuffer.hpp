 * @brief Base class that provides the standard message buffer interface to
 * FreeRTOS::MessageBuffer and FreeRTOS::StaticMessageBuffer.
 *
 * @note This class is not intended to be instantiated by the user.  Use
 * FreeRTOS::MessageBuffer or FreeRTOS::StaticMessageBuffer.
 *
 * @warning Uniquely among FreeRTOS objects, the stream buffer implementation
 * (so also the message buffer implementation, as message buffers are built on
 * top of stream buffers) assumes there is only one task or interrupt that will
 * write to the buffer (the writer), and only one task or interrupt that will
 * read from the buffer (the reader).  It is safe for the writer and reader to
 * be different tasks or interrupts, but, unlike other FreeRTOS objects, it is
 * not safe to have multiple different writers or multiple different readers. If
 * there are to be multiple different writers then the application writer must
 * place each call to a writing API function (such as send()) inside a critical
 * section and set the send block time to 0.  Likewise, if there are to be
 * multiple different readers then the application writer must place each call
 * to a reading API function (such as read()) inside a critical section and set
 * the receive block time to 0.

   * Sends a discrete message to the message buffer.  The message can be any

   *
   * Use send() to write to a message buffer from a task.  Use sendFromISR() to
   * write to a message buffer from an interrupt service routine (ISR).
   *
   * @param data A pointer to the message that is to be copied into the message
   * buffer.
   * @param length The length of the message.  That is, the number of bytes to
   * copy from data into the message buffer. When a message is written to the
   * message buffer an additional sizeof( size_t ) bytes are also written to
   * store the message's length.  sizeof( size_t ) is typically 4 bytes on a
   * 32-bit architecture, so on most 32-bit architecture setting length to 20
   * will reduce the free space in the message buffer by 24 bytes (20 bytes of
   * message data and 4 bytes to hold the message length).
   * @param ticksToWait The maximum amount of time the calling task should
   * remain in the Blocked state to wait for enough space to become available in
   * the message buffer, should the message buffer have insufficient space when
   * send() is called.  The calling task will never block if ticksToWait is
   * zero.  The block time is specified in tick periods, so the absolute time it
   * represents is dependent on the tick frequency.  The macro pdMS_TO_TICKS()
   * can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds into a time
   * specified in ticks.  Setting ticksToWait to portMAX_DELAY will cause the
   * task to wait indefinitely (without timing out), provided
   * INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend is set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.  Tasks do not use any
   * CPU time when they are in the Blocked state.
   * @return size_t The number of bytes written to the message buffer.  If the
   * call to send() times out before there was enough space to write the message
   * into the message buffer then zero is returned.  If the call did not time
   * out then length is returned.

   * have a task blocked on it waiting for data. Calling sendFromISR() can make
   * data available, and so cause a task that was waiting for data to leave the
   * Blocked state. If calling sendFromISR() causes a task to leave the Blocked
   * state, and the unblocked task has a priority higher than the currently
   * executing task (the task that was interrupted), then, internally,
   * sendFromISR() will set higherPriorityTaskWoken to true. If sendFromISR()
   * sets this value to true, then normally a context switch should be performed
   * before the interrupt is exited. This will ensure that the interrupt returns
   * directly to the highest priority Ready state task. higherPriorityTaskWoken
   * should be set to false before it is passed into the function. See the code
   * example below for an example.
