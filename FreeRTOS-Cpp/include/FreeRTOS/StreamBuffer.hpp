 * @class StreamBufferBase StreamBuffer.hpp <FreeRTOS/StreamBuffer.hpp>
 *
 * @brief Base class that provides the standard stream buffer interface to
 * FreeRTOS::StreamBuffer and FreeRTOS::StaticStreamBuffer.
 *
 * @note This class is not intended to be instantiated by the user.  Use
 * FreeRTOS::StreamBuffer or FreeRTOS::StaticStreamBuffer.
 *
 * @warning Uniquely among FreeRTOS objects, the stream buffer implementation
 * (so also the message buffer implementation, as message buffers are built on
 * top of stream buffers) assumes there is only one task or interrupt that will
 * write to the buffer (the writer), and only one task or interrupt that will
 * read from the buffer (the reader).  It is safe for the writer and reader to
 * be different tasks or interrupts, but, unlike other FreeRTOS objects, it is
 * not safe to have multiple different writers or multiple different readers. If
 * there are to be multiple different writers then the application writer must
 * place each call to a writing API function (such as send()) inside a critical
 * section and set the send block time to 0.  Likewise, if there are to be
 * multiple different readers then the application writer must place each call
 * to a reading API function (such as read()) inside a critical section and set
 * the receive block time to 0.
