   * Each task has a private array of "notification values" (or
   * 'notifications'), each of which is a 32-bit unsigned integer (uint32_t).
   * The constant configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES sets the number of
   * indexes in the array, and (for backward compatibility) defaults to 1 if
   * left undefined.  Prior to FreeRTOS V10.4.0 there was only one notification
   * value per task.
   *
   * Events can be sent to a task using an intermediary object.  Examples of
   * such objects are queues, semaphores, mutexes and event groups.  Task
   * notifications are a method of sending an event directly to a task without
   * the need for such an intermediary object.
   *
   * A notification sent to a task can optionally perform an action, such as
   * update, overwrite or increment one of the task's notification values.  In
   * that way task notifications can be used to send data to a task, or be used
   * as light weight and fast binary or counting semaphores.
   *
   * notifyTake() is intended for use when a task notification is used as a
   * faster and lighter weight binary or counting semaphore alternative.  Actual
   * FreeRTOS semaphores are taken using the FreeRTOS::Semaphore::take() API
   * function, the equivalent action that instead uses a task notification is
   * notifyTake().
   *
   * When task notifications are being used as a binary or counting semaphore
   * equivalent then the task being notified should wait for the notification
   * using the notificationTake() API function rather than the notifyWait() API
   * function.
   *
   * notifyTake() can either clear the task's notification value at the array
   * index specified by the indexToWaitOn parameter to zero on exit, in which
   * case the notification value acts like a binary semaphore, or decrement the
   * notification value on exit, in which case the notification value acts like
   * a counting semaphore.
   *
   * A task can use notifyTake() to [optionally] block to wait for a
   * notification.  The task does not consume any CPU time while it is in the
   * Blocked state.
   *
   * Where as notifyWait() will return when a notification is pending,
   * notifyTake() will return when the task's notification value is not zero.
   *
   * @note Each notification within the array operates independently - a task
   * can only block on one notification within the array at a time and will not
   * be unblocked by a notification sent to any other array index.
   *
   * @param ticksToWait The maximum time to wait in the Blocked state for a
   * notification to be received if a notification is not already pending when
   * notifyTake() is called.  The RTOS task does not consume any CPU time when
   * it is in the Blocked state.  The time is specified in RTOS tick periods.
   * The pdMS_TO_TICKS() macro can be used to convert a time specified in
   * milliseconds into a time specified in ticks.
   *
   * @param clearCountOnExit If an RTOS task notification is received and
   * clearCountOnExit is set to false then the RTOS task's notification value is
   * decremented before notifyTake() exits. This is equivalent to the value of a
   * counting semaphore being decremented by a successful call to
   * FreeRTOS::Semaphore::Take(). If an RTOS task notification is received and
   * clearCountOnExit is set to true then the RTOS task's notification value is
   * reset to 0 before notifyTake() exits. This is equivalent to the value of a
   * binary semaphore being left at zero (or empty, or 'not available') after a
   * successful call to FreeRTOS::Semaphore::Take().
   *
   * @param index The index within the calling task's array of notification
   * values on which the calling task will wait for a notification to be
   * non-zero. index must be less than configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES.

   * configUSE_TASK_NOTIFICATIONS must be undefined or defined as 1 for these
   * functions to be available.
   *
   * Each task has an array of 'task notifications' (or just 'notifications'),
   * each of which has a state and a 32-bit value. A direct to task notification
   * is an event sent directly to a task that can unblock the receiving task,
   * and optionally update one of the receiving task’s notification values in a
   * number of different ways. For example, a notification may overwrite one of
   * the receiving task’s notification values, or just set one or more bits in
   * one of the receiving task’s notification values.
   *
   * notifyWait() waits, with an optional timeout, for the calling task to
   * receive a notification. If the receiving RTOS task was already Blocked
   * waiting for a notification when the notification it is waiting for arrives
   * the receiving RTOS task will be removed from the Blocked state and the
   * notification cleared.
   *
   * @note Each notification within the array operates independently - a task
   * can only block on one notification within the array at a time and will not
   * be unblocked by a notification sent to any other array index.
   *
   * notifyGive() must not be called from an interrupt service routine. Use
   * notifyGiveFromISR() instead.
   *
   * @param ticksToWait The maximum time to wait in the Blocked state for a
   * notification to be received if a notification is not already pending when
   * notifyWait() is called.
   *
   * The RTOS task does not consume any CPU time when it is in the Blocked
   * state.
   *
   * The time is specified in RTOS tick periods. The pdMS_TO_TICKS() macro can
   * be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds into a time specified
   * in ticks.
   *
   * @param bitsToClearOnEntry Any bits set in bitsToClearOnEntry will be
   * cleared in the calling RTOS task's notification value on entry to the
   * notifyWait() function (before the task waits for a new notification)
   * provided a notification is not already pending when notifyWait() is called.
   *
   * For example, if bitsToClearOnEntry is 0x01, then bit 0 of the task's
   * notification value will be cleared on entry to the function.
   *
   * Setting bitsToClearOnEntry to 0xffffffff (ULONG_MAX) will clear all the
   * bits in the task's notification value, effectively clearing the value to 0.
   *
   * @param bitsToClearOnExit Any bits set in bitsToClearOnExit will be cleared
   * in the calling RTOS task's notification value before notifyWait() function
   * exits if a notification was received.
   *
   * The bits are cleared after the RTOS task's notification value are returned.
   *
   * For example, if bitsToClearOnExit is 0x03, then bit 0 and bit 1 of the
   * task's notification value will be cleared before the function exits.
   *
   * Setting bitsToClearOnExit to 0xffffffff (ULONG_MAX) will clear all the bits
   * in the task's notification value, effectively clearing the value to 0.
   *
   * @param index The index within the calling task's array of notification
   * values on which the calling task will wait for a notification to be
   * received. index must be less than configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES.
   *
   * @retval true If a notification was received, or a notification was already
   * pending when notifyWait() was called.
   * @retval false If the call to notifyWait() timed out before a notification
   * was received.
   * @return The RTOS task's notification value as it was before any bits were
   * cleared due to the bitsToClearOnExit setting.
   *
