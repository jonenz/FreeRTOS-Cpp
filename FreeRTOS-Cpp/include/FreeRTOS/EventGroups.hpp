   * clearOnExit is set to false then the bits set in the event group are not
   * altered when the call to wait() returns.
   * @param waitForAllBits waitForAllBits is used to create either a logical AND

   * bits must be set) as follows: If waitForAllBits is set to true then wait()

   *
   * Setting bits in an event group will automatically unblock tasks that are
   * blocked waiting for the bits.
   *
   * Setting bits in an event group is not a deterministic operation because
   * there are an unknown number of tasks that may be waiting for the bit or
   * bits being set. FreeRTOS does not allow non-deterministic operations to be
   * performed in interrupts or from critical sections. Therefore
   * xEventGroupSetBitFromISR() sends a message to the RTOS daemon task to have
   * the set operation performed in the context of the daemon task - where a
   * scheduler lock is used in place of a critical section.
   *
   * @note As mentioned in the paragraph above, setting bits from an ISR will
   * defer the set operation to the RTOS daemon task (also known as the timer
   * service task). The RTOS daemon task is scheduled according to its priority,
   * just like any other RTOS task. Therefore, if it is essential the set
   * operation completes immediately (before a task created by the application
   * executes) then the priority of the RTOS daemon task must be higher than the
   * priority of any application task that uses the event group. The priority of
   * the RTOS daemon task is set by the configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY definition in
   * FreeRTOSConfig.h.
   *
   * @param higherPriorityTaskWoken As mentioned above, calling this function
   * will result in a message being sent to the RTOS daemon task. If the
   * priority of the daemon task is higher than the priority of the currently
   * running task (the task the interrupt interrupted) then
   * higherPriorityTaskWoken will be set to true by setFromISR(), indicating
   * that a context switch should be requested before the interrupt exits. For
   * that reason higherPriorityTaskWoken must be initialised to false. See the
   * example code below.
   * @param bitsToSet A bitwise value that indicates the bit or bits to set in
   * the event group.
   * @retval true If the message was sent to the RTOS daemon task.
   * @retval false Otherwise or if the timer service queue was full
