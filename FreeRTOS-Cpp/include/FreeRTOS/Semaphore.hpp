   * should be performed before the interrupt is exited. This will ensure that

 *
 * Binary semaphores and mutexes are very similar but have some subtle

 *
 * Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:
 *  1. <b>Counting Events:</b>
 * In this usage scenario an event handler will 'give' a semaphore each time an
 * event occurs (incrementing the semaphore count value), and a handler task
 * will 'take' a semaphore each time it processes an event (decrementing the
 * semaphore count value). The count value is therefore the difference between
 * the number of events that have occurred and the number that have been
 * processed. In this case it is desirable for the initial count value to be
 * zero. Note the same functionality can often be achieved in a more efficient
 * way using a direct to task notification.
 *
 *  2. <b>Resource Management:</b>
 * In this usage scenario the count value indicates the number of resources
 * available. To obtain control of a resource a task must first obtain a
 * semaphore - decrementing the semaphore count value. When the count value
 * reaches zero there are no free resources. When a task finishes with the
 * resource it 'gives' the semaphore back - incrementing the semaphore count
 * value. In this case it is desirable for the initial count value to be equal
 * to the maximum count value, indicating that all resources are free.
